<h1>Hi, I'm <a href="https://malibiran.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daryl Malibiran</a>, a web developer based in the Philippines.</h1>
<p><strong>I finally decided to choose the web development path. I created this second Github account to track my developer journey.</strong></p>
<p>I'm passionated in Web Performance Optimization, Vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS (Vanilla and Frameworks). I'm currently learning advanced JavaScript, Typescript, Node.js, Svelte/SvelteKit, Bulma CSS, Tailwind CSS, and some GIT stuff. Yeah, this sounds a lot.</p>
